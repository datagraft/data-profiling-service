# Data profiling API for Grafterizer

Initial NodeJS/ Loopback project for generating statistics and data summary queries. Currently CSV format is supported.

The REST API is based on [Datalib](https://vega.github.io/datalib) - a JavaScript data utility library that facilities data loading, type inference and common statistics.

Currently deployed to [Heroku](https://visrec.herokuapp.com/explorer/) for testing purposes (minor delay when starting service due to free account at Heroku).
